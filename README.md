## Item Filter Support for Visual Studio Code

An extension for Visual Studio Code that provides additional support for writing [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) item filters, making it easier to create item filtes for the game.

## Features

As of right now, the colorizer is the only feature, though this alone makes editing item filters a lot easier within the editor.

A language server is currently being developed, which will bring autocompletion and diagnostic support in the near future.
